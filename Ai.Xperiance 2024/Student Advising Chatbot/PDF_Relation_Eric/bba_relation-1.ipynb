Students will also complete flexible electives (Business or College) in order to reach the credit\\nhour requirement for the BBA degree.\\nImmersive Experiential Elective\\nAt least one business elective course must be tagged as an immersive experiential elective. All IE\\nelectives address an issue or need that is complex and ambiguous. They give students the opportunity\\nto apply knowledge and create value in a real world setting. IE electives fall into one of three categories:\\nPage 12 of 83\\n1. Business Transformation - Creates value in an existing company via analysis of and\\nimprovement plans for business processes, services, or products\\n2. Business Innovation - Addresses a critical business or societal problem by bringing a new\\nventure or innovation forward\\n3. Business Knowledge Creation - Augments business practice and/or knowledge through research\\nStudents will choose an IE elective from a pre-tagged list of electives. The IE elective counts towards the\\nsix business elective requirement and may also count towards an area depth(s).\\nAREA DEPTHS\\nCLASS OF 2024\\nThe BBA curriculum requires the completion of a minimum of at least one primary area depth consisting\\nof four elective courses from a designated set. This allows all students to build at least one area of\\nexpertise within the fields of business.\\nSome courses are housed in one academic area but very closely correlate with another, and as such, are\\nconsidered bridge courses. Students wishing to pursue more than one area depth may use one and only\\none bridge elective to fulfill the requirements in two primary depths. As a result, the following numbers\\nof electives are required for the combination of multiple area depths:\\n• One primary and one secondary area depth = 7 electives total, or 6 unique electives if one is a\\nbridge elective\\n• Two primary area depths = 8 electives total, or 7 unique electives if one is a bridge elective\\n• One primary and two secondary area depths = 10 electives total, or 8 unique electives if two\\ndifferent bridge electives are used (note: only one related elective may be counted towards a\\ngiven depth)\\n• Two primary area depths and one secondary area depth = 11 electives total, or 9 unique\\nelectives if two different bridge electives are used (note: only one related elective may be\\ncounted towards a given depth)\\n• Three primary area depths = 12 electives total, or 10 unique electives if two different bridge\\nelectives are used (note: only one related elective may be counted towards a given depth)\\nStudents should work with their BBA advisor to track progress towards area depth(s) in real time. Area\\ndepths may be added or modified throughout a student’s time in the BBA Program.\\nPRIMARY AREA DEPTHS – CLASS OF 2024\\nACCOUNTING\\nAccounting is the language of business, and fluency in financial reporting, the legal environment, and\\ntaxation should be part of your vocabulary. Every business decision involves choices of transaction\\nstructure, resource allocation, reporting to constituents such as shareholders, creditors, and investors,\\nand compliance with many levels of government regulation and taxation. The Accounting area depth\\ngives you critical skills to help you make complex decisions in an ever-changing environment.\\nPage 13 of 83\\nBusinessweek recently ranked Goizueta\\'s undergraduate accounting program #3 in the U.S., and roughly\\none-third of our BBAs acquire an area depth in accounting. We offer two accounting tracks — one for\\nFinancial Accounting and Analysis and one for Professional Accounting (CPA).\\nThe BBA area depth in accounting is pursued by students preparing for careers in corporate finance,\\nfinancial analysis, investment banking, portfolio management, venture capital and private equity, and\\ncommercial lending. In your future career as a professional, when deciding whether to allocate capital\\nyou will have to analyze and predict future performance and risks for firms. Strong fundamental\\nunderstanding of financial reporting and accounting and strong analytical and conceptual thinking are\\ncrucial components of such predictions.\\nStudents preparing for professional careers in accounting can complete CPA requirements by either\\npursuing the MPA (Master of Professional Accounting) degree or by completing a suggested subset of\\naccounting elective coursework that exceeds the 4 minimum electives required for the BBA depth. If\\nyou follow this path, you will join professional accounting firms in their auditing, forensic, tax, or\\nconsulting practices. Other common career paths include internal audit and financial management in\\ncorporations and governmental and not-for-profit entities, as well as careers that focus on a wide range\\nof professional capabilities to serve the business community. Corporate managers prefer the advice of\\naccounting information experts who understand the organization as a whole and the strategic and\\ntactical problems of senior management. Many of the top financial professionals —the controller, the\\ntreasurer, the director of internal auditing, the director of financial planning, the vice president of\\nfinance, the chief financial officer — are CPAs.\\nACCOUNTING AREA DEPTH REQUIREMENTS\\nFOUR elective courses from the following (ACT):\\n300 - Business Analysis and Valuation\\n312A - Financial Reporting of Operations M,P (formerly Financial Reporting I)\\n312B - Financial Reporting of Debt & Equity M,P (formerly Financial Reporting II)\\n330 - Personal Financial Planning P2\\n399R - Special Topics: Firm Fundamentals and Mispricing\\n399R - Special Topics: Performance Management for Strategy M,P1\\n399R - Special Topics: LedgerTech: Blockchain and Crypto\\n399R - Special Topics: Machine Learning for Fundamental Analysis\\n399R - Special Topics: Strategic Cost Management M,P\\n399R - Special Topics: Sustainability Measurement and Reporting\\n499R - Special Topics: Corporate Political Strategy\\n420 - Accounting Analytics: Insights for Actions (formerly Special Topics: Data Analytics for Financial\\nBusiness Decisions) M,P\\n516 - Accounting for Government and Nonprofit Organizations P1\\n517 - Professional Accounting Research (last offered in Fall 2022)\\n650 (formerly 612) - Accounting for Business Combinations and Multinational Operations P1\\n613 - Advanced Managerial Accounting\\n615 - Federal Income Tax M,P\\n616 - Corporate and Partnership Taxation P2\\n618 - Auditing M,P\\n619 - International Accounting (last offered in Fall 2022)\\nM Students wishing to pursue the Certified Management Accounting (CMA) certification should take all courses designated ‘M’.

Other common career paths include internal audit and financial management in\\ncorporations and governmental and not-for-profit entities, as well as careers that focus on a wide range\\nof professional capabilities to serve the business community. Corporate managers prefer the advice of\\naccounting information experts who understand the organization as a whole and the strategic and\\ntactical problems of senior management.

F indicates\\nfailure and is a permanent notation on the transcript. I (Incomplete) indicates that the student has not\\ncompleted all the work for a course. W indicates withdrawal without penalty and indicates no academic\\ncredit earned. WF indicates withdrawal failing. F and WF receive no academic credit, and factor into the\\nGPA calculation at a value of 0 quality points.\\nFor each semester hour of credit, quality points are computed as follows:\\nA = 4.0 B– = 2.7 D+ = 1.3\\nA– = 3.7 C+ = 2.3 D = 1.0\\nB+ = 3.3 C = 2.0 F = 0.0\\nB = 3.0 C– = 1.7\\nSatisfactory/Unsatisfactory (Pass/Fail)\\nThe Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) option is not available for Goizueta Business School courses with\\nthe exception of BUS 380, 381, 382 and 480, which are S/U only.\\nOn an exceptional basis, a graduating senior student may request permission to take a Business School\\nelective on an S/U basis if all of the following criteria are met:\\n• The class does not count toward (is above and beyond) the total hours needed to graduate.\\n• The course does not count toward the student\\'s area depth.\\n• The course does not count toward the required minimum number of business electives.\\n• The student is able to obtain the faculty member’s and Senior Associate Dean of the BBA\\nProgram’s permission.\\nBusiness School students may take a maximum of two College classes graded S/U while enrolled in the\\nBusiness School. College classes taken on an S/U basis must be at least 300-level and may not be applied\\ntowards an Area Depth.\\nThe total number of S/U classes taken while at Emory may not exceed four. Any PE course, except\\nHealth, may be taken S/U. PE courses do not count towards the total number of classes that may be\\ntaken S/U while in the Business School. Courses taken S/U in March 2020 due to the COVID-19\\npandemic do not count towards the total.\\nGrade Appeals Process\\nGrade appeals are exercised only in egregious and exceptional circumstances and, as such, are rare.\\nStudents should be aware that grading is the prerogative of the faculty member. There are only three\\nscenarios that may result in a successful argument for a change of grade:\\n• The faculty member calculated the grade incorrectly and the student has documentation to\\nprovide evidence.\\nPage 60 of 83\\n• Criteria used in grading were different than those set forth in the syllabus and/or provided orally\\nto the class.\\n• There is objective evidence that the student was graded according to criteria or a scale other\\nthan that by which others in the class were graded.\\nStudents who believe such a scenario may apply to them should contact their academic advisor. If a\\nformal appeal is filed, it must be put in writing to the faculty member with stated reasons for the\\nrequest. If it remains unresolved, the student, in consultation with the Program Director, should forward\\nthe same information with any relevant new information to the Area Coordinator. If it still remains\\nunresolved, the final step would be to forward the same information with any relevant new information\\nto the Vice Dean, whose decision will be final.\\nIncomplete Work\\nThe notation “I” is recorded whenever the student has been granted formal permission by the\\ninstructor, with approval of the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA Program, to defer a final examination\\nor part of a course. Arrangements to receive an incomplete must be made prior to the end of the\\nsemester. Deferments are not permitted except for severe illness or other serious emergencies and\\nmust be approved prior to the date of the examination. The obligation to complete the work and the\\nconditions under which the incomplete will be removed will be set forth by the faculty member. Failure\\nto satisfy those conditions will result in assignment of grade under the original grading rubric of the\\ncourse as set forth in the syllabus. In all cases, incomplete work must be completed during the student’s\\nnext semester of residence, or within twelve months if the student does not reenroll. Failure to\\ncomplete the course by the appropriate deadline will result in a grade of F.\\nProbation and Suspension Guidelines\\nStudents placed on probation are expected to concentrate on bringing their work up to the required\\nstandard. The following regulations adopted by faculty decree are subject to change by the faculty at\\nany time.\\n1. A student whose semester grade point average is 1.0 or greater but less than 2.0 will be placed\\non probation for the subsequent semester. A student on probation must earn a minimum\\nsemester average of 2.0 and at the end of the probationary semester have a minimum\\ncumulative grade point average of 2.0. Failure to do so will result in academic suspension. The\\nsummer term will be treated as a semester for probation purposes for any student who enrolls\\nin twelve hours or more of course work.\\n2. A student whose semester grade point average is below 1.0 will be automatically suspended.\\n3. Undergraduate students suspended for academic deficiency may petition to the Faculty\\nEducation Committee for readmission. The minimum suspension is one semester. The Faculty\\nEducation Committee will consider petitions for readmission during the suspended semester.\\nThe petition must be submitted in writing to the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA Program by\\nFebruary 15th for requested fall semester return or October 1st for a requested spring semester\\nreturn. Late submission of the petition may result in a delayed return.\\na. If a petition brought before the Faculty Education Committee is denied, the student may\\nnot resubmit a petition for readmission until one calendar year after the date of the\\ndenial.\\nb. If a student is suspended more than one time, a petition for readmission will not be\\nconsidered until at least one calendar year after the date of suspension.\\nc. A student may at any time be put on probation by the Dean for neglect of duty, failure\\nto make satisfactory progress towards degree, or other cause, irrespective of grades.\\nPage 61 of 83\\nd. Any student who in the opinion of the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA Program is not\\nmaking satisfactory progress shall be formally notified of delinquency at the end of any\\nsemester and may be advised to withdraw. If such a student, after being advised to\\nwithdraw, elects to remain in school, the case may be brought to the Faculty Education\\nCommittee. If in the opinion of the Committee or the Dean the student is not making\\nsatisfactory progress at the end of the following semester, that student shall be\\nsuspended.\\n4. Students who return after being suspended are readmitted with probationary status. A student\\non probation must earn a minimum semester grade point average of 2.0 and at the end of the\\nprobationary semester must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 in order to\\nremain in the program.\\nOfficial Transcripts\\nThe academic transcript is an official record of a student\\'s grades. Transcripts may be requested via\\nOPUS or the University Registrar’s office. In most cases, electronic transcripts are delivered within\\nminutes of placing your order. Transcript requests for paper copies are normally processed within two\\nbusiness days of receiving your request. For those whose last enrollment was prior to Summer 1990,\\nplease allow additional processing time.\\nOfficial transcripts bearing the University seal and validating signatures are sent as directed by the\\nstudent’s request to agencies or institutions as confidential information. All transcripts include the\\nentire academic record. No partial or incomplete statements of record will be issued as transcripts. For\\nprompt receipt of transcripts, students should make requests within a reasonable time before needed.\\nDelay in issuing transcripts may occur immediately before or after a term break. Official transcripts can\\nbe sent to agencies or institutions, provided the student’s record shows no financial indebtedness to the\\nUniversity.\\nTransfer Credit/Transient Study Prior to Matriculation into the BBA Program\\nThe BBA Program honors decisions made by the Emory Office of Undergraduate Admission regarding\\ntransfer, Advanced Placement, and International Baccalaureate credit, including all limits. Evaluation of\\ncredit will occur prior to matriculation into the BBA Program and no retroactive credit will be\\napplied. Additionally, transient study credit granted in accordance with Emory and Oxford College\\npolicies and applied prior to matriculation into the BBA Program will be honored.\\nTransient Study After Matriculation into the BBA Program\\nTransient study may be earned domestically or internationally.\\nDomestic transient study at U.S. institutions is granted only for summer enrollment. Students who wish\\nto complete coursework elsewhere prior to earning 64 credit hours at Emory must secure written\\npermission from the BBA Program Office before the end of the preceding spring semester. Permission\\nmay be obtained via the Summer 2024 BBA Transient Study Request Form which will be reviewed by the\\nAssistant Dean for BBA Academic Affairs, working in conjunction with the Goizueta Faculty Education\\nCommittee. In order to earn credit through Domestic Transient Study, students must earn a grade of C\\nor above. The course credits, but not the grades, are posted on the official Emory transcript.\\nInternational transient study is normally granted only for summer enrollment. Students who wish to\\ntake summer work at non-U.S. institution, other than through Emory-sponsored programs, prior to\\nearning 64 credit hours at Emory must secure written permission from the BBA Program Office before\\nthe end of the preceding spring semester. Permission may be obtained via the Summer 2024 BBA\\nPage 62 of 83\\nTransient Study Request Form which will be reviewed by the Assistant Dean for BBA Academic Affairs,\\nworking in conjunction with the Goizueta Faculty Education Committee. In order to earn credit students\\nmust earn a grade equivalent of C or above, with equivalency determined prior to participation. The\\ncourse credits, but not the grades, are posted on the official Emory transcript.\\nIn all cases of domestic or international transient study:\\n• Students on academic probation at the time of request or after the completion of spring\\nsemester are ineligible.\\n• Credit earned at other institutions may not be counted towards the last 64 semester hours or\\nfour semesters of work toward the BBA degree.\\n• A final transcript for any summer coursework must be submitted by October 1 immediately\\nfollowing the summer in which the coursework was completed.\\n• All credits for non-Emory courses must officially appear on the student’s transcript by the end of\\ntheir first semester upon return to Emory. It is the student\\'s responsibility to follow up to\\nensure that this occurs.\\nAtlanta Regional Council for Higher Education (ARCHE) Program\\nARCHE Cross Registration is a program developed and sponsored by the Atlanta Regional Council for\\nHigher Education. Under certain conditions the program allows students to take a course at a member\\ninstitution that may not be offered at the home institution. Students must be full-time and in good\\nstanding. Courses are taken on a space available basis. The student is registered at the host institution as\\na \"special\" student only. Cross Registration does not constitute regular admission and the student has\\naccess only to those facilities needed to successfully complete the course(s).\\nEmory University students who wish to enroll for courses at an ARCHE member institution must\\ncomplete a Cross Registration application form and receive approval from their school dean or academic\\nadvisor and the University Registrar. Applications must be received in the Registrar’s Office by the\\ndeadline date. There may be other requirements for enrollment (immunization records). More\\ninformation is available here.\\nNon-Degree Seeking Students\\nStudents from other divisions of Emory University who are not enrolled in the Business School may\\nenroll in undergraduate Business School classes on a space-available basis, with instructor approval,\\nproviding all course prerequisites are satisfied. Non-BBA students may enroll in a maximum of 8 hours\\nper semester and a total of 16 hours. Emory College of Arts and Sciences students should carefully\\nconsult College of Arts and Sciences policy regarding application of BBA coursework toward Emory\\nCollege graduation requirements.\\nRegistration\\nStudents must be officially registered for courses on OPUS and must appear on the professor’s roll to be\\neligible to receive credit for a course. Course enrollment will not be granted after the completion of the\\nadd/drop/swap period, regardless of class attendance. Students are allowed to preregister on dates set\\nby the Goizueta Business School Registrar’s Office. Students are limited to enrollment in 20 credit hours\\nper semester. Students registering for fewer than twelve hours in any semester other than a student’s\\nfinal semester must obtain approval from the Assistant Dean of the BBA Program\\nChanging Courses\\nStudents who change their schedule after the original registration date are required to follow the\\nprocedures and calendar posted by the Goizueta Business School registrar’s office. Business School\\nPage 63 of 83\\nstudents may utilize online add/drop/swap procedures. Enrollment is strictly limited by capacity. Once a\\ncourse has closed, additional enrollment will occur on a space-available basis from a sequential waiting\\nlist. Neither advisors nor the instructor of record has the capacity to add a student to a closed class\\nWithdrawal from Courses\\nAny student who withdraws voluntarily from a class after the specified drop/add period must obtain a\\nsigned partial withdrawal form. Students withdrawing prior to the end of the sixth full week of classes\\nwill receive a grade of W. Thereafter, a student who withdraws will receive a grade of WF. In calculating\\nthe student’s overall average, the grade of WF is counted as an F. The grade of W is not calculated into\\nthe overall average. A student who withdraws from class after the sixth week for documented health\\nreasons, or under other extraordinary circumstances, may petition the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA\\nProgram in writing at the time of withdrawal in order to receive a grade of W. If the situation so\\nwarrants, a recommendation that a grade of W be awarded will be forwarded to the faculty member,\\nwho will make the final determination. Under no circumstances will a grade of WF be converted to a\\ngrade of W after it has been issued.\\nRepeating a Course\\nIf a student receives credit for successful completion of a course, they may not repeat the course for\\ncredit. If a student enrolls into the same course a second time, those duplicate credit hours will be\\nexcluded from their credit hour total in the Degree Tracker.\\nComplete Voluntary Withdrawal\\nA student may withdraw in full from the BBA program at any time prior to the beginning of the final\\nexamination period. Upon voluntary withdrawal, grades of W or WF are recorded as set forth above. A\\nstudent who withdraws from class after the sixth week for documented health reasons, or under other\\nextraordinary circumstances, may petition the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA Program at the time of\\nwithdrawal in order to receive ful withdrawal with all grades of “W.” Any relevant partial refunds within\\nthe first four weeks of classes s are dependent on the date of withdrawal. During the Summer semester\\nonly, students receiving permission for a partial (course) withdrawal may be eligible for a partial refund.\\nThe University’s refund schedule is included in the Emory University Schedule of Courses Bulletin,\\navailable from the Office of the Associate Director of Academic Services.\\nInvoluntary Withdrawal\\nEmory University considers the safety and welfare of its students, faculty and staff a top priority. When a\\nstudent engages in behavior that violates Emory’s rules of conduct, the behavior will be addressed as a\\ndisciplinary matter under the applicable Student Conduct Code. The Student Conduct Code defines\\nprohibited conduct and outlines a process for conducting disciplinary proceedings.\\nThis Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure is not a disciplinary code, policy or process. It is not\\nintended to apply to situations in which a student engages in behavior that violates the University’s\\nrules of conduct. It is intended to apply when a student’s observed conduct, actions and/or statements\\nindicate a direct threat to the student’s own health and/or safety, or a direct threat to the health and/or\\nsafety of others. There may be situations in which both this Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and the\\nStudent Conduct Code may apply. In all cases, the Dean of the Goizueta Business School, or his/her\\ndesignee, shall have final authority regarding the decision, enactment, enforcement and management of\\nthe involuntary withdrawal of a student. Such a process will occur in accordance with University policy.\\nPage 64 of 83\\nClass Attendance\\nAll class attendees must be officially registered by the appropriate University official. A registered\\nstudent who fails to attend class can be involuntarily withdrawn from that class at the discretion of the\\nfaculty member in consultation with the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA Program. A grade of W or WF\\nwill be assigned in accordance with the policy outlined above. It is expected that students enrolled in\\nGoizueta Business School will attend all classes, except in the very exceptional case of a dire emergency.\\nOutside responsibilities, work obligations, job interviews, travel plans, and minor emergencies are not\\nsufficient to excuse a student from class. Classes are highly interactive, and team assignments rely on all\\nstudents being active class participants. Course attendance regulations are the prerogative of individual\\nfaculty members, who may use class attendance, class participation, or any combination thereof in any\\nstated percentage in the calculation of the course grade. Students who are on probation may be subject\\nto additional regulations and disciplinary action based on class attendance.\\nAbsences from Examinations\\nAny student who fails to submit a required course assessment or take a required examination when\\nnormally scheduled may not take this examination without both the consent of the faculty member and\\nwritten permission from the BBA Program Office. In such cases permission will be granted only for\\nverified, documented illness for which the care of a physician was required or other verified\\nextraordinary and compelling reasons. A BBA student seeking to defer a major in-course exam or final\\nexam due to illness or emergency must be granted formal permission by the Associate Dean of the BBA\\nProgram. Such deferments will be granted only in the following circumstances, all of which must be\\nindependently documented and verified:\\n1. Illness requiring in-patient hospitalization during the time of the exam.\\n2. Death of an immediate family member (grandparent, parent, or sibling) at the time of the\\nexam, or immediately prior.\\n3. Illness for which a treating physician provides independent, written documentation directly to\\nthe Program Office stating that the student is medically incapable of taking the exam because\\nof health risk to himself/herself or others. In the event that such documentation is not\\navailable, with written consent from the student, if the BBA Program Office can verbally\\nconfirm with a physician in Student Health that the student is medically incapable of taking\\nthe exam because of health risk to himself/herself or others, then the student will be excused.\\n4. Other extraordinary circumstances beyond the student’s control for which documentation can\\nbe provided and for which there is absolutely no alternative.\\nExcept in the case of #1 or #2, such documentation must be received prior to the exam in order\\nto be excused. In the case of #1 and #2, documentation must be provided no later than 24 hours\\nafter the exam and must cover the time of the exam.\\nIn the absence of this documentation, the faculty member may assign a zero for the missing\\nassessment. If a make-up is allowed without documentation, the faculty member also has the\\ndiscretion to limit the grade a student can earn on that assessment.\\nA student who reports for and takes any part of a final examination ordinarily will not be allowed to\\ndefer or retake that final. Deferred examinations must be taken at the beginning of the student’s next\\nsemester of residence, or at a time designated by the faculty member. In the absence of this\\ndocumentation, the faculty member may assign a zero for the missing assessment. If a make-up is\\nallowed without documentation, the faculty member also has the discretion to limit the grade a student\\ncan earn on that assessment.\\nPage 65 of 83\\nAuditing a Course\\nThe BBA Program does not officially recognize audits. Students may therefore not register to audit any\\nBBA course. With the permission of the instructor and on a space available basis, students may\\nunofficially visit any course for which they are eligible to register, but no record is kept of courses so\\nvisited.\\nEnrollment in an MBA Course\\nUndergraduate students are not permitted to enroll in MBA courses. On an exceptional basis, if an\\nelective is not offered in the BBA Program, a student may request permission to enroll in a listed MBA-\\nlevel course. Permission will be granted if and only if four conditions are met: 1) the faculty member\\nagrees to accommodate the student, 2) there is excess enrollment capacity in the class, 3) the Academic\\nDean of the Program in which the course is listed gives permission for an undergraduate student to\\nenroll, and 4) the Senior Associate Dean of the BBA Program grants permission for the specific student\\nto enroll. Assuming all these conditions are met, the student should contact the Assistant Dean to be\\nenrolled in the course as an undergraduate Directed Study. This sets the criteria for grading within the\\nBBA grading structure.\\nResidency Requirement\\nThe BBA Program requires that students be enrolled for a minimum of two full academic years and a\\nminimum of 63 credit hours after matriculation. The residency requirement is in place to allow students\\nadequate time both to complete academic requirements and to engage in meaningful opportunities to\\napply the skills learned in the classroom. Regardless of the number of semesters a student has\\npreviously completed at Emory University or elsewhere, BBA students must complete a minimum of\\nfour semesters of full-time residency in either Fall or Spring terms after matriculation into the Business\\nSchool. A full-time course load in a Summer semester cannot replace one of the required semesters.\\nHowever, a part-time course load in a Summer semester and a part-time course load in a student’s\\nfourth semester will be considered equivalent to one full-time semester.\\nIn the case of extraordinary circumstances that absolutely prevent a student from meeting the four\\nsemester residency requirement, exceptions will be considered by petition to the Faculty Education\\nCommittee. These are granted in exceptional cases, and only to students who will otherwise complete\\nall degree requirements and course hours in residence at Goizueta Business School.\\nResidency on a full-time basis in a Goizueta Business School-approved exchange program may be\\napplied to the four-semester requirement, assuming approval is granted prior to embarking on the\\nprogram. Participation in a study abroad program outside of Goizueta Business School cannot be applied\\nto the four-semester residency requirement. No retroactive residency status or enrollment requests can\\nbe granted.\\nReturning to Emory College\\nIf a student enrolled in the BBA Program wishes to return to Emory College to complete their degree,\\nthey must notify their BBA advisor. The student must complete Emory College’s Readmission Request\\nForm. The Goizueta Business School Registrar will drop the student’s schedule and discontinue them\\nfrom the Goizueta Business School at the conclusion of five business days. Once approved for\\nreadmission to Emory College, students can work with Emory College and the Office of Undergraduate\\nEducation to re-enroll for subsequent semesters.\\nPage 66 of 83\\nStudent Complaint Policy\\nStudents who wish to file a complaint that does not fall within the jurisdiction of an academic area, the\\nhonor code or the conduct code should offer discuss the concern with the appropriate personnel in the\\nBBA Program Office.\\nFederal financial aid laws and regulations require that each state have a process to review and act on\\ncomplaints concerning educational institutions in the state. If you have a complaint, you may, of course,\\nfile a complaint with Emory’s financial aid office or call the Trust Line at 1-888-550-8850 or file a report\\nonline. You may also file a complaint about Emory University with the State of Georgia Office of\\nInspector General by following the directions at the Office of Inspector General (OIG) website. In the\\nevent that OIG receives a student complaint relating to financial aid, it will be forwarded to the Office of\\nInspector General of the U.S. Department of Education.\\nWaivers of Academic Regulations\\nStudents may appeal to the Goizueta Education Committee for waivers of existing academic regulations\\nand requirements in individual cases.\\nPage 67 of 83\\nHONORS AND AWARDS\\nDean’s List\\nInclusion on the Dean\\'s List is based on comparative semester grade point average for that semester.\\nBBA students in full residence who fall within the top 20% of their expected graduating class by\\nsemester grade point average are recognized on the Dean\\'s List for that semester. In addition to the\\nrequisite class standing, a student must have a cumulative grade point average in the Business School of\\n3.0 or above and must have been enrolled for twelve or more hours, completed all course work, and\\nearned no grades of Unsatisfactory in that semester.\\nBeta Gamma Sigma\\nBeta Gamma Sigma is the international honor society serving business programs accredited by AACSB\\nInternational. The mission of the society is to encourage and honor academic achievement in the study\\nof business and personal and professional excellence in the practice of business. Invitation to\\nmembership is the highest recognition a business student can achieve, anywhere in the world. At the\\nundergraduate level, membership is extended to those students who both stand in the top 10% of the\\ngraduating class and who display the personal and professional attributes befitting the society.\\nGraduation Honors and Awards\\nStudents whose work has been particularly outstanding during their time at Emory will be granted\\ndegrees with distinction, depending on the candidate\\'s final class standing relative to the total\\ngraduating BBA Class. The calculation is inclusive of all graduates, including those from the Summer and\\nFall of the preceding year. For the class of 2024 this calculation is based on grades earned after\\nmatriculation in to the BBA program. For the class of 2025 and beyond, the calculation is based on the\\nearned cumulative GPA across all semesters at Emory.\\nGraduating with honors in the business school is earned by rank:\\nHighest Distinction (Top 5%)\\nHigh Distinction (Next 5%, up to 10%)\\nDistinction (Next 10%, up to 20%)\\nBBA Program Graduation Awards\\nBBA SCHOLAR ATHLETE AWARD\\nPresented to the graduating business student who has most effectively balanced the demands of varsity\\nathletics with the rigors of his or her academic program.\\nCAMPUS LEADERSHIP AWARD\\nGiven to the graduating senior who has served as an exemplary BBA representative through leadership\\nbeyond Goizueta Business School and whose eff orts have made an extraordinary contribution to the\\nlarger university community.\\nBUDNICK AWARD FOR TRANSFORMATION THROUGH CREATIVITY\\nAwarded to the senior who has most successfully applied artistic and creative talents to enhance and\\nexpand the horizons of the Business School or University.\\nINTERNATIONAL AMBASSADOR AWARD\\nPresented to the student who has done the most to assist the school in its eff orts to forge cross-cultural\\nties and extend its global reach.\\nPage 68 of 83\\nBBA CAREER MANAGEMENT CENTER AWARD\\nAwarded to the graduating student whose eff orts have expanded the School’s outreach and helped to\\naugment career opportunities for BBA students.\\nBBA MERITORIOUS SERVICE AWARD\\nPresented to the senior who has significantly enhanced the undergraduate business student experience\\nthrough service beyond expectations and who has supported the mission of the BBA Program.\\nFARAAZ HOSSAIN CORE VALUES AWARD\\nPresented to the senior who embodies principled leadership by demonstrating personal and\\nprofessional growth and intellectual development, and who is driven to create positive impact in\\norganizations.\\nTRANSCENDENCE AWARD\\nAwarded to a graduating BBA student who serves as a role model in breaking down barriers and\\ndemonstrating resilience, and whose accomplishments extend beyond perceived boundaries.\\nUNSUNG HERO AWARD\\nPresented to the graduating student who has rendered notable service to the program, the University,\\nor the larger community, without expectation of recognition.\\nBURT AND BETTY SCHEAR BOOK PRIZE\\nAwarded on a university-wide basis to the student most likely to make a uniquely positive mark on his or\\nher universe.\\nBOISFEUILLET JONES MEDAL\\nPresented to the graduating senior who best represents qualities of devoted service, integrity, character\\nand contribution.\\nANDREW ETHRIDGE OUTSTANDING BBA ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\\nGiven to the graduating BBA senior who has made the most significant contribution to community life\\nduring his or her tenure at Emory.\\nMOST OUTSTANDING ACADEMIC ACCOMPLISHMENT\\nPresented to the graduating student who has amassed the most distinguished academic record in the\\nprogram.\\nJOHN ROBSON OUTSTANDING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AWARD\\nThe Business School’s highest graduation award, presented to a graduating student, selected from\\namongst all of the school’s programs, who has best contributed to Goizueta Business School in its\\nongoing eff orts to achieve excellence across all facets of the institution.\\nROBERTO C.
